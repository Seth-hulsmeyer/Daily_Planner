# Daily_Planner

This interactive daily planner displays the current date with the use of the moment API

<img scr = "assets/Planner1.PNG" width = "500">

The user can save their daily tasks into local storage, and the time-block rows are colored based off of their relative position to the current time.

<img scr = "assets/Planner2.PNG" width = "500">

If the time-block is in the past it will be shaded grey, if it is in the present it will be shaded red, and if it is in the future it will be shaded green.
